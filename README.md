# Python Maze Solver

---

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to design a Python application with a fully functional GUI for generating and solving randomized mazes from a square grid of tiles. The maze itself is represented using the graph data structure, allowing for various graph traversal algorithms to be incorporated into maze solving techniques. Completing this project provides an intuitive understanding of graphs, graph traversal algorithms, and Python user interface design using `PyQt6`.

## The Maze Solver

The program can be run by executing `MazeSolver.py`. Alternatively, if `pyinstaller` is present on the machine (it can be installed with pip), running the following command will generate an executable for the application:

`pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole MazeSolver.py`

The executable can be found in the `\dist` directory created by `pyinstaller`.

Upon launch, the application appears as follows:

The "Maze Size" slider controls the length and width of the next maze generated by clicking the "Generate Maze" button. When clicked, the maze itself is generated using a randomized Depth First Search to create a spanning tree of the graph of maze nodes. This means that all the maze nodes are reachable, but there is only one path from beginning to end.

The selection box allows the user to select one of three graph traversal algorithms for solving a generated maze. For the A* algorithm, the heuristic used is the Euclidean distance between the current coordinates in the maze and the coordinates of the exit. The "Slow  Factor" slider adds a small amount of delay between steps in both the maze generation algorithm and the solving algorithms (The exact amount is one-tenth of a millisecond times the slow factor). This allows the user to watch the generation and solving algorithms as they work rather than allowing them to proceed as fast as possible. 

Lastly, the Runtime Log on the right-hand side stores the runtimes for each operation, including generation and solving. This can be used to compare the runtimes of different solving algorithms for different maze sizes. The log can be reset at any time using the "Reset Log" button.

Below is an example of a maze after solving with the A* algorithm:

The entrance and exit of the maze are represented by the bright red and blue tiles respectively. The light-blue tiles represent nodes explored during the search algorithm, while the green tiles represent the solved path between the entrance and exit of the maze.
